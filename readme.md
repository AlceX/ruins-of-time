# Ruins of Time

Top down puzzler about controlling the age of objects. Remake of one my first games. Made this as little experiment in working with a stricter [style guide](https://github.com/AlceX/ruins-of-time/blob/master/style_guide.md) and source control with Construct 2. Did all the experimenting I wanted, so I won't be continuing it.
